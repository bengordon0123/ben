<p>	By looking at the 2015 statistics behind which athletic brand individuals prefer 
most, consumers can conclude which apparel is best for them to work out in. For this 
project, I surveyed three well known brands, Nike, Puma, and Adidas. For each company, 
I looked at how much revenue they generated in the past fiscal year. In addition to 
this, I took into consideration each company’s product offerings and when each company 
was founded. </p>
<p>	In 2015, Nike generated $29.5 billion in revenue. Compared to Puma and Adidas, 
Nike is the industry leader as they have the widest array of workout gear to offer 
to consumers. While Puma and Adidas were founded before Nike, Nike has proven to 
have more control over the American consumer market and also has offered more 
innovative products. Nike’s most compelling product is its sneaker line. </p>
<p> In 2015, Adidas generated $17.9 billion in revenue. When compared against Nike 
and Puma, Adidas comes in second with regards to overall revenue generated. Adidas' 
strength is centered around the European market, which is why their sales in Europe 
are stronger than in America. Recently, Adidas has jumped onto the scene by signing 
popular individuals such as Kanye West and James Harden to lead their sneaker line.</p> 
<p> Out of all three companies, Puma posted the lowest revenue in the past fiscal year. 
This can be attributed to the notion that Nike dominates the large majority of the 
American market, and Adidas thrives in Europe. Precisely, Puma generated $3.6 billion 
in the fiscal year of 2015 and still posted exceptional financial metrics for a company 
not acting as the lead in its sector." </p>
